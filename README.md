# E-commerce Purchase Prediction

1.	Project topic and description:

    For my project, I will be focusing on purchase prediction specifically for an e-commerce company. The main goal is to address the need for the organization to understand and anticipate when customers are most likely to make a purchase. By accurately predicting this, the company can take targeted actions, such as offering personalized discounts or reminders, at just the right moment. This approach not only helps in boosting sales but also ensures that marketing efforts are more efficient, leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased revenue. The project aims to bridge the gap between customer behavior and the company's actions, ensuring that opportunities to convert potential buyers into actual buyers are maximized.

2.	Project purpose and goals:
  The purpose of my project is to demonstrate to develop a purchase prediction model for an e-commerce organization. This model will help the company anticipate when a customer is most likely to make a purchase, enabling more effective and personalized marketing strategies. The primary goal is to create a system that analyzes customer behavior and provides actionable insights, leading to better decision-making for increasing sales and customer engagement. Through this project, I aim to illustrate how predictive analytics can drive business growth by aligning marketing efforts with customer needs in real-time.
